# Randstad Data Analysis Bootcamp
___

This repository is intended to document my experience throughout the Randstad Data Analysis Bootcamp. All code and documentation will be mainly in English, even though the classes were taught in PT-BR.

## Prologue: First Steps
We started with some Git courses to introduce code versioning and portfolio creation. Since I've been familiar with GitHub for a while now, it was mostly a good refresher.

## Chapter I: Artificial Intelligence (AI)
The first chapter focused on introducing the fundamentals of AI, including its key concepts and applications. We explored the differences between AI, Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), uderstanding how AI serves as the broader field, while ML allows systems to learn from data and NLP enable machines to process and undestand human language.

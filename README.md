# Randstad Data Analysis Bootcamp

This repository is intended to document my experience throughout the Randstad Data Analysis Bootcamp. All code and documentation will be primarily in English, even though the classes were conducted in Portuguese (PT-BR). This choice is intentional, as I aim to improve my English skills while building this repository.

## Prologue: First Steps
We started with some Git courses to introduce code versioning and portfolio creation. Since I've been familiar with GitHub for a while now, it was mostly a good refresher.

## Chapter I: Artificial Intelligence (AI)
The first chapter focused on introducing the fundamentals of AI, including its key concepts and applications. We explored the differences between AI, Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), uderstanding how AI serves as the broader field, while ML allows systems to learn from data and NLP enable machines to process and undestand human language.

## Chapter VIII: BI Fundamentals
This was one of the chapters I enjoyed the most! Although it was quite challenging - particularly because I had never worked with Power BI before - it turned out to be incredibly engaging and rewarding. Learning how to navigate a new tool pushed me out of my comfort zone, but it also provided valuable insights and a strong sense of achievement.

A highlight of this chapter was the lab project at the end, in which I worked with a financial sample dataset to create interactive reports, like the one shown above. This practical experience helped solidify the concepts and gave me a clearer picture of how BI tools can transform raw data into meaningful insights.
